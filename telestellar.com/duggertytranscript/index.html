<p>NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK; THURSDAY, MAY 18, 2032 7:00 A.M.</p>

<p>Dept. no. 465 Hon. Helena X. Nirvana, Judge</p>

<p>Trial 13/50</p>

<p>(The following proceedings were held in open court, out of the presence of the jury:)</p>

<p>THE COURT: We are back with Mr. Duggerty and his attorney. We are also here with a representative from Telestellar’s information analysis department, as well as an attorney from Telestellar.</p>

<p>THE COURT: Mr. Duggerty, will you please take the stand for interrogation by the Telestellar attorney.</p>

<p>MR. DUGGERTY: Yes, ma’m.</p>

<p>T ATTORNEY: Good morning, Mr. Duggerty. I would like to ask you a few questions concerning the recent breach in the Telestellar information analytics department concerning Betelgeuse. Are you aware of this breach?</p>

<p>MR. DUGGERTY: Well, we’ve been in trial for two weeks now, so yes I am aware at this point.</p>

<p>T ATTORNEY: Please answer with either ‘yes’ or ‘no.’</p>

<p>MR. DUGGERTY: Judge Nirvana, when will I be interrogated by a real human who can parse through my answers?</p>

<p>THE COURT: Mr. Duggerty, please comply to what the attorney asks of you. Human-on-human interrogation is not as accurate as multiple AI rounds.</p>

<p>MR. DUGGERTY: Yes.</p>

<p>T ATTORNEY: Thank you. Shortly after this breach, you were recorded traveling to Switzerland. Is this true?</p>

<p>MR. DUGGERTY: Yes. For the thirteenth time.</p>

<p>T ATTORNEY: And why did you go to Switzerland?</p>

<p>MR. DUGGERTY: To ski. Like I do every year.</p>

<p>T ATTORNEY: The recent economic shifts caused by the sociopolitical reconfiguration encouraged by Telestellar have negatively affected your wealth. Is this true?</p>

<p>D ATTORNEY: I object. This question is attempting to frame the interviewee.</p>

<p>THE COURT: Sustained.</p>

<p>T ATTORNEY: How did the sociopolitical reconfiguration caused by Telestellar’s system affect your wealth?</p>

<p>MR. DUGGERTY: My status had shifted, but I was still living comfortably.</p>

<p>T ATTORNEY: But the real estate market changed dramatically when Telestellar users became interested in galactic grouping as a means of housing.</p>

<p>MR. DUGGERTY: This is true. But your conventional penthouses and apartment complexes on the Upper East Side were still in high demand.</p>

<p>T ATTORNEY: You delayed your decision to find out which star you are matched with. Can you explain why?</p>

<p>MR. DUGGERTY: Because I wasn’t sure how I felt about it.</p>

<p>T ATTORNEY: Yet you did end up undergoing the process after returning from Switzerland.</p>

<p>MR. DUGGERTY: Yes because any social group is now based off knowing what Telestellar claims you identify with. It became hard to carry on a high-class life in NYC without that status.</p>

<p>T ATTORNEY: Did you have your DNA altered to receive Betelgeuse as a match?</p>

<p>MR. DUGGERTY: No, I did not.</p>

<p>T ATTORNEY: Can you repeat this five times?</p>

<p>MR. DUGGERTY: No, I did not. No, I did not. No, I did not. No, I did not. No, I did not.</p>

<p>T ATTORNEY: Your face shows signs of anxiety.</p>

<p>MR. DUGGERTY: Of course. I’m sitting in a fucking courtroom just like I have been for two weeks. I’m stressed out.</p>

<p>T ATTORNEY: Were you surprised when your match ended up being Betelgeuse?</p>

<p>MR. DUGGERTY: No, someone was bound to get it eventually.</p>

<p>T ATTORNEY: Betelgeuse’s status exemplifies your previous economic status, which allowed you to go back to your high-status lifestyle. Is this true?</p>

<p>D ATTORNEY: Your honor, I object.</p>

<p>THE COURT: Overruled. Please answer the question, Mr. Duggerty.</p>

<p>MR. DUGGERTY: Yes, I got attention over it. My financial success was still due to my real estate decisions.</p>

<p>T ATTORNEY: So the Betelgeuse information breach correlating with your trip to Switzerland, the DNA black market capital, is just coincidental?</p>

<p>MR. DUGGERTY: I know that it looks strange, but yes. I was just matched with Betelgeuse because the DNA I was born with translates to it.</p>

<p>T ATTORNEY: No further questions.</p>

<p>THE COURT: If Mr. Duggerty’s attorney also has no questions, we will bring Telestellar’s information analysis representative, Luke Gelmans to the stand.</p>
