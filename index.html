<h2>Our system</h2>
	Telestellar employs cutting edge technology and a state-of-the-art system for generating the connections between your DNA and the makeup of a star. The process relies on conventional salivatory testing for DNA, which is then translated into stellar data and matched to the star that shares the most similar reading.<a class="inWhite" href="about.html">Learn more...</a>
