			Telestellar has developed cutting edge technology in order to harvest rare materials from any known star in the Milky Way Galaxy. Each expedition happens upon your order–i.e. we don’t pre-collect materials. This way, the gift you seek for your loved one is unique to your vision. The voyage matters just as much as the product: it represents your dedication and can be carefully tracked and used as part of the gift itself.

			Extraction of precious materials from the stars comes in a variety of forms nearly as extensive as the stars in the universe. Consultants seek your interests based off of your designated star and aid in choosing a custom star composition to bring home to your loved one. Materials can be sculpted, illuminated, suspended, or just about anything else given our advanced technology. Check out a list of potential ideas and our testimonials from customers below.

			Star mining is the future of energy and element acquisition. Until now, ownership of a star entailed naming it and observing it from a strictly Earth viewpoint. Star mining allows star owners to go beyond seeing the star as a twinkling spectacle and use it as property for financial gain.
